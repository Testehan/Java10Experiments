JDK 10 new features

    1.JEP 286: Local-Variable Type Inference
        We seek to improve the developer experience by reducing the ceremony associated with writing Java code,
        while maintaining Java's commitment to static type safety, by allowing developers to elide the
        often-unnecessary manifest declaration of local variable types. This feature would allow, for example,
        declarations such as:
            var list = new ArrayList<String>();  // infers ArrayList<String>
            var stream = list.stream();          // infers Stream<String>

        This treatment would be restricted to local variables with initializers, indexes in the enhanced
        for-loop, and locals declared in a traditional for-loop; it would not be available for method formals,
        constructor formals, method return types, fields, catch formals, or any other kind of variable declaration.

        Description
            The identifier var is not a keyword; instead it is a reserved type name. This means that code that uses
            var as a variable, method, or package name will not be affected; code that uses var as a class or
            interface name will be affected (but these names are rare in practice, since they violate usual
            naming conventions).
